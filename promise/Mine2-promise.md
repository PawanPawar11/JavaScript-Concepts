Great question, Pawan! You're diving into the **execution order** of JavaScript — specifically how it handles **synchronous and asynchronous code**. Let's walk through **why**:

```js
console.log(
  setTimeout(() => {
    promisedValue;
  }, 6000)
);
```

runs **before** the inner logic inside:

```js
else if (a == 2) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve({ msg: "The Promise got resolved in block 2" });
  }, 3000);
  console.log("The Promise which bypass the 5 second lock in block 2");
}
```

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 🔹 First, understand the difference:

* `setTimeout(...)`: Schedules a **callback function** to run **after a delay**. But calling `setTimeout` itself is **synchronous**.
* `console.log(...)`: Also runs **synchronously**.
* `new Promise(...)`: Executes the promise executor **immediately** (synchronously).

---

## 🧭 Execution Order of Your Code

Let’s follow your script step-by-step:

### ✅ Step 1: The `Promise` is created

```js
const promisedValue = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // 'a' is 2
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve({ msg: "The Promise got resolved in block 2" });
  }, 3000);
  console.log("The Promise which bypass the 5 second lock in block 2");
});
```

* The `Promise` executor runs **immediately**.
* The `setTimeout(..., 3000)` is called → it schedules the resolve after 3 seconds.
* Then the `console.log("The Promise which...")` runs immediately.

✅ So this `console.log(...)` runs early — **even before** `.then()` or the 3-second timeout.

---

### ✅ Step 2: The `.then()` and `.catch()` are attached

```js
promisedValue
  .then(...)
  .catch(...);
```

This is also synchronous. You're saying:

> “When the promise resolves, run this function.”
> But it doesn’t run yet — it **waits** for the resolve.

---

### ✅ Step 3: This line:

```js
console.log(
  setTimeout(() => {
    promisedValue;
  }, 6000)
);
```

Here’s what happens:

* `setTimeout(...)` is a function call.
* It **immediately returns** a timer ID (a number, e.g. 7 or 12), which is logged by `console.log(...)`.

✅ So, this `console.log(...)` line runs **immediately** — because you're not waiting for the 6 seconds here, you're **just calling** `setTimeout(...)` and logging its return value.

---

### 🧾 What Actually Runs in Order:

1. The `Promise` constructor executes.
2. Inside it:

   * `setTimeout(..., 3000)` is called → task is scheduled.
   * `console.log("The Promise which bypass...")` runs.
3. `promisedValue.then(...).catch(...)` runs (sync).
4. `setTimeout(..., 6000)` is called → logs the timer ID (e.g., `1`) immediately.
5. ⏱️ After 3 seconds → resolve happens → `.then()` callback runs.
6. ⏱️ After 6 seconds → that anonymous function (doing `promisedValue;`) runs — but it does nothing!

## 🛠️ Extra Tip:

This line:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  promisedValue;
}, 6000)
```

Does **nothing useful** — you’re referencing `promisedValue` but not doing anything with it.

To see something meaningful after 6 seconds, maybe try:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("After 6 seconds:", promisedValue);
}, 6000);
```

That will log the **fulfilled** promise after it’s resolved.

## ✅ Final Summary

| Code Line                                   | Sync or Async          | When it Runs                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `setTimeout(() => ..., 3000)`               | Sync call → Async task | Scheduled immediately, runs after 3s |
| `console.log("...")` inside `if/else`       | Synchronous            | Runs immediately                     |
| `.then()` & `.catch()`                      | Synchronous setup      | Handlers are added immediately       |
| `console.log(setTimeout(...))`              | Synchronous            | Logs timer ID immediately            |
| `setTimeout(() => { promisedValue }, 6000)` | Async                  | Runs after 6s, but does nothing      |
